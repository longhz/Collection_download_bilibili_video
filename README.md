# Collection_download_bilibili_video
This is a download script source code, 
used to automatically download bilibili favorite video, of course, 
before using you need to get to your favorite_id: fid,
and then modify the config.ini, the attachment has a packaged zip file,
well ... It is a bit big, because it contains ffmpeg and python3.7, 
you can first install these yourself in the system to set the environment variables, 
and then use my script. 
I will continue to improve it later  Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)
